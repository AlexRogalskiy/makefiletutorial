Makefile Tutorial by Example
========

This is a single page website that has index.html, which is created by the file `index.md`. It uses github page's automatic jekyll compilation to do the conversion.

Run this locally by running `jekyll serve` in this directory. I've tested it with jekyll 4.0.0
